Part 1:
with each line split it between the spaces to get a list of numbers.
Create two pointers going from either side (this may be overcomplicating the problem)
while those pointers are not at the ends of the list check if the next value going forwards and backwards is valid
if by the end either the numbers are increasing or decreasing by the at least 1 and by max 3 then add to total

Part 2:
Essentially the same except I loop through the code with every input variation to show a number being removed.
