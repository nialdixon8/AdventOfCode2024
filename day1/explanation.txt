Part 1:
loop through each input line (This will likely be a common theme).
Append each side to a seperate list and then sort the lists. This could perhaps be sorted in place but I have done it this way.
Loop through the sorted lists accumulating all the differences.

Similar initial process but with no sorting.
Loop through the left list. Multiply the count of every value of x in the rightList by x itself with x being the current leftList value.
Accumulate all these values to get the total
